Welcome to DataCity! DataCity is a place for open source standard city data that will follow rigorous guidelines about how data is collected and stored within it's walls. 

DataCity will have three components that will make it a viable platform for all users that want to enter as a citizen.

- A Concourse System that will run a continuous real time acquisition of other city data and bring them into data city.
- A potential python mid layer that will serve as an API.
- A web application that you can browse and check out data as you wish.
